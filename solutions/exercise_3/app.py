# app on - so e.g. if they jump straight to the des page via a bookmark, it will still pull in
# these defaults because behind the scenes the app.py file is still running.
# Alternatively, we could run this same block of code on both the des.py and lsoa_map.py pages
# (but we could get away without including it in the homepage.py file because that page neither
# displays nor changes the value of demand)

# Notice that here I've put the lsoa_map in between the homepage and des pages as it makes more sense
# for the user to go to the lsoa map (to choose their region for demand) rather than going to the
# des page first
# i.e. the order of pages in the list will affect the order they appear in the sidebar for the user
